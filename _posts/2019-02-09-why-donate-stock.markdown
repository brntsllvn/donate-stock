When donating stock, you avoid paying tax.

Money you would normally pay to the federal government - tax on capital gains - goes directly to your choice nonprofit.

Donating stock directly (under the right circumstances) results in a bigger donation and a bigger deduction versus selling the same stock, paying capital gains tax and donating the proceeds.

Below is a comparison of donating stock versus selling stock, then donating the cash proceeds.

Notes and assumptions
+ The donor [itemizes](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc501) her taxes.
+ The [Capital Gain Tax Rate](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409) is 20% plus 3.8% Medicare [Net Investment Income Tax](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/questions-and-answers-on-the-net-investment-income-tax).
+ No state or local taxes factored in.
+ The credit card fee is 3% (some fundraisers charge 5%...c'mon!).
+ My hypothetical fee of 2%.
+ The donor has not bumped into the [AGI deduction limits](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/charitable-contribution-deductions).
+ Morgan Stanley Stock Plan trade fee is $14.95 (which is one of the worst I've ever seen...).
+ There's a little quirk in donation/deduction fee numbers. When you make a donation by credit card, the processor charges 3%. So, say you pay $100, then the charity gets $100 - $3 = $97 and your deduction is $97. Donating stock, at least with my widget, is a little different. Since the charity pays my fee, you still deduct the whole amount. For example, if you donate a share worth $100, the charity collects the share and you get a tax receipt for $100. The charity will (almost always) liquidate the share immediately, then pay the amount I invoice them ($2 in the example above). Here's the [IRS publication](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p526#en_US_2014_publink1000229793) and a [TurboTax reference](https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/2930081-are-processing-fees-for-charitable-contributions-tax-deductible) to back this up.
