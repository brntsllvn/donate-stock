When donating stock, you avoid paying tax.

Money you would normally pay to the federal government - tax on capital gains - goes directly to your choice nonprofit.

Donating stock directly (under the right circumstances) results in a bigger donation and a bigger deduction versus selling the same stock, paying capital gains tax and donating the proceeds.

Below is a comparison of donating stock versus selling stock, then donating the cash proceeds.

Notes and assumptions
+ The donor [itemizes](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc501) her taxes.
+ The [Capital Gain Tax Rate](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409) is 20% plus 3.8% Medicare [Net Investment Income Tax](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/questions-and-answers-on-the-net-investment-income-tax).
+ No state or local taxes factored in.
+ The donor has not bumped into the [AGI deduction limits](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/charitable-contribution-deductions).
+ Morgan Stanley Stock Plan trade fee is $14.95 (which is one of the worst I've ever seen...)
