When donating stock, you [avoid capital gains tax](/2019/02/08/why-donate-stock.html), but under the new [Tax Cuts And Jobs Act](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5307.pdf) the standard deduction has "[nearly doubled ](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/individuals)" for all filers. In that case, why bother donating stock if you don't plan on itemizing?

Your choice nonprofit still gets the full benefit of your stock donation whether you itemize or not. You also avoid fees (trading, etc.) when donating stock (although, double-check your broker does not charge a fee to transfer stock...some are shady and charge a fee...those jerks).

The slides below are the same as [here](/2019/02/08/why-donate-stock.html), with a slight tweak.

In any case, keep donating stock. Your choice nonprofit will thank you!
