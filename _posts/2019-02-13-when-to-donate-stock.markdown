excerpt: Keep in mind blackout dates, processing time and the IRS calendar.

When donating stock, you avoid paying capital gains tax.

But you must keep in mind timing issues like:
+ IRS contribution rules
+ Processing time
+ Corporate blackout windows

This slide illustrates a hypothetical calendar year with constraints that might impact your stock donation. Your company's earnings calendar and corresponding blackout windows will likely differ.

IRS Contribution Rules
---
[Publication 526](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p526.pdf) (search for "When To Deduct") says we deduct in the year we make a contribution. So, deduct a stock donation made in calendar year 2016 on your 2016 tax return (usually filed before Apr 15 2017). I illustrate this with thick solid lines on Jan 1 and Dec 31 in the slide above. 

Processing Time
---
Transferring stock between brokerage accounts takes about *seven* days (it's annoying...I know). I show this little hiccup by truncating the amount of green available in Dec for donating stock. Start your donation at least a couple weeks before the end of the calendar year.

Corporate Blackout Windows
---
Are you an "insider" at your company? If so, *your company may consider donating company stock the same as selling company stock* and bar your ability to donate or sell your company's stock during so-called blackout windows (usually following the quarterly earnings announcement). Ask HR 1) if you are an insider (most people at large, well-known tech companies are insiders) and 2) if stock donations are subject to blackout windows. I illustrate this yellow circles (for earnings announcements) followed by green rectangles (hypothetical trading windows) in my slide above.

Conclusion
---
Donating stock, despite the complications above, is worth it. Find out if you are an insider and if your company considers stock donations the same as selling stock, which might be subject to trading blackouts. And remember that stock donations are deductible in the year they are made.
