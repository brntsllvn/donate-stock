A donor-advised fund is a nonprofit that donates to other nonprofits using your advice.

    alt="a meme showing an utterly confused man looking at a butterfly and wondering if 'this is a nonprofit?' the joke is that donor-advised funds are confusing if not a little suspicious." %}

The idea is that you donate stock to a donor-advised fund and they immediately give you a tax receipt. Next, you tell the donor-advised fund _where_ to send your donation. They already sold the stock you donated, so now they're ready to send the cash (mostly) wherever you like. 

What's the point? Well... the donor-advised fund will invest "your" (it's not yours anymore) money until you're ready to distribute it. They charge a fee (usually a little elevated <sup>my opinion</sup>) for pretty basic investment management. It's also nice that all your investment stuff lives in a single location. But you pay for these conveniences.

The big donor-advised funds are...
+ [Vanguard Charitable](https://www.vanguardcharitable.org/), minimum donation: $25,000, annual fee: 0.60% <sup>[actually more](https://www.vanguardcharitable.org/individuals/fees_and_expenses)</sup>
+ [Fidelity Charitable](https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/), minimum donation: $5,000, annual fee: 0.60% <sup>[actually more](https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/giving-account/giving-account-details.shtml)</sup>
+ [Schwab Charitable](https://www.schwabcharitable.org/public/charitable/home), minimum donation: $5,000, annual fee: 0.60% <sup>[sometimes more](https://www.schwabcharitable.org/public/charitable/features/fees_and_minimums)</sup>

Other big ones include...
+ [Silicon Valley Community Foundation](https://www.siliconvalleycf.org/donor-advised-funds), minimum donation: $5,000, annual fee: 1.00%
+ [Seattle Foundation](https://www.seattlefoundation.org/), minimum donation: $250,000, annual fee: 1.00%
+ [Network For Good](https://www.networkforgood.org/donate/). No minimum, and a different model altogether, but still checks the "donor-advised fund" box on its required annual filing (yes, this is a real thing). Processes credit card donations for 3%-5%.

Donor-advised funds provide some value-add at a cost. My wife and I use Schwab Charitable for a very-specific reason that I'll write about another time. Between the slightly-elevated fees and another a [weird donor tendency](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/business/donor-advised-funds-tech-tax.html), I have mixed feelings.
