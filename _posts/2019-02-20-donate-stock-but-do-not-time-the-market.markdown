excerpt: Dollar-cost-average your stock donations.

In [this post]({% post_url 2019-02-13-when-to-donate-stock %}), I wrote about when to donate stock (pretty much as your company allows it) and deliberately omitted any mention of market timing because the markets are mostly efficient. Not perfectly so, but not worth any amateurish effort to beat them.

My wife and I [dollar-cost-average](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/dollar-cost-averaging-2/) our donations (Wealthfront calls this dollar-cost-averaging [in reverse](https://blog.wealthfront.com/manage-vested-rsus/) since we're reducing our position instead of adding to it). For example: donate five shares of MSFT each quarter without regard for the current price. 

The point is: make a donation plan and stick to it. Consistency keeps your head clear of the vicissitudes of the market.
