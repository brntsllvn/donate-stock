In [this post]({% post_url 2019-02-13-when-to-donate-stock %}), I wrote about when to donate stock (pretty much as your company allows it) and deliberately omitted any mention of market timing. Because...well...market timing is bullshit.

My wife and I [dollar-cost-average](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/dollar-cost-averaging-2/) our donations. For example: donate five shares of MSFT each quarter. Whatever your plan, donate regularly and consistently with little regard for the precise value of the stock.

Market timing is bullshit. Sorry. It is. The markets are efficient. Maybe not perfectly so, but not worth any amateurish effort to beat them. Read some stuff by [Fama](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/f/eugene-f-fama) or [Malkiel](https://www.amazon.com/Random-Walk-Down-Wall-Street/dp/1324002182) if you disagree.
