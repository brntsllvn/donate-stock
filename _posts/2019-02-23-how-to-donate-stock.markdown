Donating stock [makes sense mathematically]({% post_url 2019-02-09-why-donate-stock %}), but the mechanics are annoying. Below are the details.

## work in progress

...but here are the main points...
+ make sure your choice nonprofit accepts stock donations (some do not have a brokerage account)
+ find your broker's form
+ fill in the form <----- this can be tricky because you need to examine each stock's acquired date and basis
+ print the form (boo...sorry)
+ sign the form
+ fax the form (yuck!)
+ let the nonprofit know if you have not already done so!
+ save the response from the nonprofit (you'll use it to itemize later)
+ itemize your taxes (turbotax example follows...maybe even a manual tax filing example)

## Conclusion

It takes me about an hour to dig up the right form, find my acquired date and basis, fill in the form, and double-check it is correct. Some people find this "extremely easy" <sup>[Lawyers](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/donating-stock-charity.html)</sup>, and others, who use their phone for everything, find it tedious or impossible. Then you have to keep track of the donation (and acquired date and basis!) until it's time to file your taxes (or use something like [Its Deductible](https://itsdeductibleonline.intuit.com/)). Shameless plug: That's why I'm building [BoonStock](https://donatestock.io), which makes it easy for everyone to donate stock. Goodbye fax machine.
