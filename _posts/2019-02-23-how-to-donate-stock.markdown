Donating stock [makes sense mathematically]({% post_url 2019-02-09-why-donate-stock %}), but the mechanics are annoying. Below are the details.

## Step by Step 

+ Call your nonprofit and make sure they accept stock donations (some do not have a brokerage account).
+ Find your broker's asset transfer form. Here are [Charles Schwab's](https://client.schwab.com/secure/file/P-2014616/APP39630-fill.pdf), and [Morgan Stanley's](https://www.stockplanconnect.com/forms/5738-SPS.pdf)
+ Login to your brokerage account and find the stock you want to donate (usually the stock with the biggest gains, held over a year, since they'll eliminate the biggest tax liability). **Note the acquired date and acquired price (i.e. the basis)**. <sub>Also note I am not your financial advisor and your mileage may vary. Talk to them.</sub>
+ Go back to the broker form and enter the ticker, acquired date and acquired price. Do your best. Even if you screw up, your broker will call you to fix the problem. Note: Morgan Stanley does not have a place to enter acquired date and acquired price...that's fine...I've just attached a little spreadsheet in the past and they've processed it without trouble.
+ Print the form
+ Sign the form
+ Fax the form (the fax number is on the brokerage form)
+ Let the nonprofit know you sent the form and the number of shares and approximate donation. Or, don't do a thing and stay anonymous. Asset transfers do not have personal info attached to them.
+ Save the response from the nonprofit for your tax records (remember, even if you don't itemize, it [still makes sense]({% post_url 2019-02-11-donate-stock-even-if-you-do-not-itemize %}) to donate stock).
+ TurboTax will ask if you donated stock. Say yes. Then they'll ask for the total amount and the acquired date and the acquired price.

<sub>Note: this is a terrible example of a stock to donate. Why? 1) it has a 1 penny **loss** and 2) I had held it for less than a year. I was testing my automated widget at the time and just wanted to donate a share to prove I could automate it end-to-end. I did. Here's a reminder on the [right conditions]({% post_url 2019-02-09-the-right-conditions-to-donate-stock %}) to donate stock.</sub>






## Conclusion

It takes me about an hour to dig up the right form, find my acquired date and basis, fill in the form, and double-check it is correct. Some people find this "extremely easy" <sup>[Lawyers](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/donating-stock-charity.html)</sup>, and others, who use their phone for everything, find it tedious or impossible. Then you have to keep track of the donation (and acquired date and basis!) until it's time to file your taxes (or use something like [Its Deductible](https://itsdeductibleonline.intuit.com/)). Shameless plug: That's why I'm building [BoonStock](https://donatestock.io), which makes it easy for everyone to donate stock. Goodbye fax machine.
