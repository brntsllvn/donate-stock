When donating stock, you avoid paying capital gains tax.

But you must keep in mind timing issues like:
+ IRS contribution rules
+ Processing time
+ Corporate blackout windows

This image illustrates some of the timing considerations when donating stock. I discuss each below.

IRS Contribution Rules
---
[Publication 526](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p526.pdf) (search for "When To Deduct") says we can only deduct in the same year we make the contribution. So, you deduct a donation made in calendar year 2016 on your 2016 tax return. I illustrate this with thick solid lines on Jan 1 and Dec 31 in the slide above. You will not lose your deduction (assuming you have not exceeded the AGI limits (again, see the Publication 526)).
<br><sub>N.B. I belabor this point because, for example, contributions to IRAs are deductible through Apr 15 (this is why TurboTax is always like, "hey, have you contributed to your IRA yet? No? We'll help you set one up." Etc.)</sub>

Processing Time
---
Transferring stock between brokerage accounts takes about 7 days. I show this little hiccup in my illustration above by truncating the amount of green available in Dec for donating stock. Start your donation at least a couple weeks before the end of the calendar year.

Corporate Blackout Windows
---
Say your corporation pays you in stock and considers you an "insider" (check with HR). You've worked for this company a while and have shares with significant appreciation (i.e. they've gone up a lot). These shares are perfect for donating. But keep in mind that *your company may consider stock transfers the same as selling stock* and controls when you can sell/donate (usually following the quarterly earnings announcement). 

Ask HR if 1) stock donations are subject to defined trading windows and, if so, 2) only initiate a donation in that window. Your company's blackout windows dominate when you can donate stock. I illustrate this concept by showing earnings announcements (yellow circles) followed by happy green trading windows in my slide above.

A Deliberate Omission: Market Timing
---
The idea you can time your stock donation to maximize your donation/deduction is foolhardy. Sorry. It is. The markets are efficient. Maybe not perfectly so, but not worth your effort to beat them. Read some stuff by [Fama](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/f/eugene-f-fama) or [Malkiel](https://www.amazon.com/Random-Walk-Down-Wall-Street/dp/1324002182) or even [Buffet](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2017ltr.pdf) if you disagree. 

My wife and I [dollar-cost-average](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/dollar-cost-averaging-2/) our donations. For example: donate five shares of MSFT each quarter (or whatever makes sense for you...just do it consistently). This takes market timing out of the equation. 

Conclusion
---
Donating stock, despite the complications above, is worth it. Spend your time following up with HR to check corporate blackout windows. Forget about timing the market.
