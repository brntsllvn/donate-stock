I wrote about [when]({% post_url 2019-02-13-when-to-donate-stock %}) you can donate stock (and [snarkily noted]({% post_url 2019-02-20-donate-stock-but-do-not-time-the-market %}) market timing should have nothing to do with it), but here I well...uh...add more conditions onto the pile.

The takeaway is that your stock should be worth more than its basis (the amount you paid for it or the value when your company awarded it to you) and the acquisition date must be more than one year in the past.

Finally, you *can* donate stock if you've held it for less than one year or its price is below its basis. Like, you're not breaking any rules. But it's sub-optimal. These slides should help.

You can find the stock's basis on your brokerage website. Note broker-specific terminology:
+ Morgan Stanley StockPlan Connect uses "Acquired Price" and "Acquired Date"
+ Charles Schwab uses "Award Price" and "Award Date"
+ "Basis" comes straight from the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p526.pdf)

<sub>Note that **acquisition date** is not the same as **vesting date**. Your company will usually "award" shares, say, when you join, and that's the date the IRS cares about. When the shares actually vest is not relevant for stock donations (except that you cannot donate unvested shares...lolz, your broker will stop you).</sub>
