I worked in investment management at PIMCO, SNWAM, and Parametric for seven years before joining Zillow as a software developer. Before that, I studied statistics and financial engineering at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY and in NYC.

Every year my wife and I donate stock. The benefits are numerous, but the process is tedious. In 2017, I built a widget to automate donating stock and now I'm making it a product others can use.
